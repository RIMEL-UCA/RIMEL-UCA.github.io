What a competition! I really enjoyed it and only hope I could have found more time. First of all, I would like to thank Raddar @raddar, Martin @ragnar123, and many others who generously shared codes and datasets! The public solutions are of amazing quality. And it also determines my game plan: create something original and blend it with the best public solution. My solution is based on RAPIDS cudf for dataframe processing, XGB for training, and pytorch lightning for feature extraction.

There are two vital observations of this dataset:

the big test data which is from the future is available.
short sequences (<13) are culprits of bad performance.
Let's start with the latter observation:the sequence length of each customer profiles plays a critical role in the model performance:

import cudf
path = '/raid/amex'
train = cudf.read_parquet(f'{path}/train.parquet',columns=['customer_ID'])
trainl = cudf.read_csv(f'{path}/train_labels.csv')
train = train.merge(trainl,on='customer_ID',how='left')
train['seq_len'] = train.groupby('customer_ID')['target'].transform('count')
train = train.drop_duplicates('customer_ID',keep='last')
train.groupby('seq_len').agg({'target':['mean','count']}).sort_index(ascending=False)
output:

           target
       mean    count
seq_len        
13    0.231788    386034
12    0.389344    10623
11    0.446737    5961
10    0.462282    6721
9     0.450164    6411
8     0.447300    6110
7     0.418430    5198
6     0.387670    5515
5     0.392635    4671
4     0.416221    4673
3     0.358602    5778
2     0.318465    6098
1     0.335742    5120
It is obvious that sequence length 13 is the most common but also with a significantly lower mean default rate. At first glance, I thought it meant shorter sequences are easier to predict since they have more positive samples. But I'm quickly proven wrong when checking my cross-validation results:

Fold 0 amex 0.7990 logloss 0.2144
Fold 0 L13 amex 0.8214 logloss 0.1928
Fold 0 Other amex 0.6724  logloss 0.3289
The 1st line is the overall score. The 2nd line is the score of sequences of length 13 and the 3rd line is the score of all the rest sequences. Apparently, shorter sequences have a much worse score than the full sequences of length 13. This is also an implication of how the short sequences are truncated: the more recent profiles are deleted, which could explain the big degradation of the score because more recent profiles have more predicting power in general. For example, let's say for 13 consecutive months (M1~M13) and sequence A is of length 13 and sequence B is of length 8:

   M1 M2 M3 M4 M5 M6 M7 M8 M9 M10 M11 M12 M13
A  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1 
B  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  0  0  0  0  0 

where 1 means features exist and 0 means features missing. Of course, there is another possibility:

   M1 M2 M3 M4 M5 M6 M7 M8 M9 M10 M11 M12 M13
A  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1 
B  0  0  0  0  0  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1 

We can actually find out which one is more plausible by unstacking dataframes in the above two ways and run xgboost with them, respectively. As expected, the former has a better CV score which indicates it is likely how the truncation of short sequences is done.

If we could somehow predict the missing profiles of sequence B, the life of the downstream XGB models would be made much easier. An intuitive choice is to generate the missing profiles using a one-dimension auto-regressive RNN. Bascially we want to predict the features of the next month based on the feature values of the current month and all previous months. And when we have the prediction for the next month, we can use it as part of the input and predict again and so on so forth. This is also where the availability of the big test data really shines. Since we are predicting features, not target, we can train our models using both train and test data. The RNN structure is very simple: just one GRU layer and some FC layers. The RNN performance is pretty decent. In terms of RMSE of all 178 numerical features, the GRU achieves validation RMSE 0.019. For simplicity, all features are log-transformed and fillna(0). You might wonder how good is RMSE 0.019. We can simply compare it with the naive baseline: just repeat the last available month. For example, if I'm asked to predict features of M2, the naive baseline is just output features of M1. The RMSE of this naive baseline is 0.03 so our RNN actually learns something and could be useful.

The rest would be straightforward, after predicting missing months, now every sequence is of length 13 so I just unstack the dataframe to increase the number of features 13x. For example, instead of having one feature P_2 of the last month, now we have 13 features P_2_M_1 to P_2_M_13. These are the most useful features I created. For downstream classifiers I only use XGB so that it is not similar to the great LGB DART notebook. By varying RNN hyperparameters, XGB hyperparameters and different combination of features, I end up with 7 XGB models, whose ensemble is 0.7993 CV and 0.799 public LB. Averaging it with the best public solution and with extraordinary luck, my final submission ended up in the gold zone.



The final thought is my best auto-regressive features are generated 1 hour before the deadline. I'm very happy it worked!

Comments:¶
This is an improvement of my baseline, you can find it here: https://www.kaggle.com/code/ragnar123/amex-lgbm-dart-cv-0-7963

The main difference between this solution and previous one is that we add new features and do seed blend to boost LB. Single 5 kfold model using seed 42 achieve an out of folds CV of 0.7977 and a public leaderboard of 0.799. If we use seed blend (train three different models using seed 42, 52, 62 and then average predictions) the LB boost niceley.

The main features that boost CV are the following:

The difference between last value and the lag1
The difference between last value and the average (this features gives a nice boost)
This feature engineer is done on all the last columns, so we actually add a lot of features, this model used 1368 features.

I uploaded test predictions to avoid running training and inference

Next Steps:

Could try feature selection, maybe a lot of the feature are just noise, actually I perform permutation importance and I reduce the amount of features to 1000 app and the CV was almost the same. Maybe there is a better feature selection technique that can boost performance.

Could try different models, maybe some neural network with the same features or a subset of the features and then blend with LGBM can work, in my experience blending tree models and neural network works great because they are very diverse so the boost is nice

Could try more feature engineering, maybe we can create more features that extract the hidden signal of the dataset, actually I would first work on this option and really try to capture all the signal that the dataset has.
