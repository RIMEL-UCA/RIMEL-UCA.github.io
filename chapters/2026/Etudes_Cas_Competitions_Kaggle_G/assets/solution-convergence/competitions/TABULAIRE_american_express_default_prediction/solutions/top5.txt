I would like to thank the organizers for organizing this competition, the participants for sharing their many insights, and my teammates( @baosenguo @wimwim @scumufeng ). Now @scumufeng and I are promoted to kaggle master and @wimwim is reaching for GM.
This competition will be unforgettable for me:)

Summary

Our solution is the result of ensembling several GBDT models , Transfomr, 2d-CNN, and GRU.
We noticed that ensemble weights are determined based on Public LB and overfit if based on CV.


Features

We are using the dataset shared with us by raddar. The features are based on those shared by ragnar.(Thanks to both of you.)

meta feature

I did not know this is called a meta feature.
This feature was useful not only in GBDT, but also in Transformer.
If added to chris's Transformer, the LB will increase from 0.790 to 793.



Pivot

Combine all features horizontally.

P_2_0 , P_2_1 , P_2_3 , P_2_4 , ... , P_2_12 , B_30_0 , ... 
 XXX  ,  XXX  ,  XXX  ,  XXX  , ... ,   XXX  ,   YYY  , ...
Model

GBDT

LightGBM
Almost no change from this Notebook
stratfiedKfold: 10
Catboost
Use GPU(I was surprised at how fast it was.)
parameter : default
Transformer

zakopuro

Based on chris's Notebook
Some additional features.(Mainly meta features)
Patrick Yam

This is his solution.
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/amex-default-prediction/discussion/348118

mufeng

Add meta feature to Patrick's transformer.
LB increased from 0.795 to 0.798.
Ensemble

Use 21 models.
Ensemble weight
Determined based on Public LB
In our case, the LB score will be lower if based on CV.(CV is 0.8016 or higher.)
We trusted Public LB more than CV because it is close to Private and has a sufficient amount of data.
Weights are not complicated. (For example, 0.1,0.2,… etc.)
Select Submit

Best LB
Public : 0.80199(2nd)
Priavte : 0.80881(6th)
Best LB*0.5 + Best CV *0.5
Public : 0.80154
Private : 0.80862(Gold zone)
Correlation check
Check the Public and Private correlation values for all predictions used in the ensemble to see that there are no significant differences.
All posts above 0.801 in Public LB were in the Gold zone in Private LB.(I prayed on the last day not to Shake down😣)

Let's enjoy kaggle! Thank you!!!!

Comments:¶
This is an improvement of my baseline, you can find it here: https://www.kaggle.com/code/ragnar123/amex-lgbm-dart-cv-0-7963

The main difference between this solution and previous one is that we add new features and do seed blend to boost LB. Single 5 kfold model using seed 42 achieve an out of folds CV of 0.7977 and a public leaderboard of 0.799. If we use seed blend (train three different models using seed 42, 52, 62 and then average predictions) the LB boost niceley.

The main features that boost CV are the following:

The difference between last value and the lag1
The difference between last value and the average (this features gives a nice boost)
This feature engineer is done on all the last columns, so we actually add a lot of features, this model used 1368 features.

I uploaded test predictions to avoid running training and inference

Next Steps:

Could try feature selection, maybe a lot of the feature are just noise, actually I perform permutation importance and I reduce the amount of features to 1000 app and the CV was almost the same. Maybe there is a better feature selection technique that can boost performance.

Could try different models, maybe some neural network with the same features or a subset of the features and then blend with LGBM can work, in my experience blending tree models and neural network works great because they are very diverse so the boost is nice

Could try more feature engineering, maybe we can create more features that extract the hidden signal of the dataset, actually I would first work on this option and really try to capture all the signal that the dataset has.

Pretrain + Finetune approach

LightGBM + Feature engineering is very successful in this competition, and they outperform NN + raw features most of the time. Because of this, I believe the features used in LGBM models are very powerful, so I decided to first let the NN learn how to do feature engineering in the pretrain stage, then finetune the model with the target after that. In this way, we provide much more guidance to train the model by using thousands of features, and most importantly we can include test data in the pretrain stage. With pretraining, the model can have +0.002 boost in public LB compared with training from scratch, and we can train a larger model (6 layers transformer) without any problem.

 

Model architecture

We use different MLP layers to handle different types of inputs (Delinquency, Spend, Payment, Balance, Risk variables), then concatenate them and pass them to the transformer encoder. After the encoding part, we take the latest node and get the outputs through a linear layer.

Pretrain stage

In the pretrain stage, our target is tabular features. We use Huber loss to train the standardized target and won't pass any loss if the feature is nan. The number of epochs is around 200 in this stage.

Finetune stage

In the finetune stage, we train the model with the label. With pretraining, the converging speed for the model is very fast and we only need less than 5 epochs per fold in this stage!

Model performance

Our best Transformer model without meta features has 0.794 CV, 0.796 public LB, and 0.804 private LB. With pseudo labeling (We use soft predictions from our best ensemble model), a single transformer model can have 0.800 public LB and 0.808 private LB. (There is leaking because we didn't use Nested K-fold CV to generate pseudo label).
