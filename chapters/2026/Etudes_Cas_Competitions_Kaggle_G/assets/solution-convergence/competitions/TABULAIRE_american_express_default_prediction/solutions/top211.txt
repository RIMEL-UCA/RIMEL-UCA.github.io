Thank you all and congrats to the winners!

My solution is very simple and straight-forward:

Created ~6000 features: aggregations, diff(1 to 5), moving average and statistics, lags divisions, trends, many interactions among the top 100 features, KMeans, PCA etc.
Selected features by permutation importances on the validation set (ended up with ~5 different features sets with ~650 to ~1400 features)
Used XGB, LGBM, Catboost models with different preprocessing strategies, feature sets, hyperparameters
Ensembled everything with different seeds (simple average of ~40 models)
XGB was always the best model for me
time spent: 10% struggling with data volume, 10% algorithms and ensemble, 80% feature engineering and selection
Single models metrics (5 fold):

amex ~ 0.797xx
roc_auc ~ 0.877xx
accuracy ~ 0.905xx
f1 ~ 0.816xx
precision ~ 0.813xx
recall ~ 0.819xx
What did not work:

I could not get dart boosting to outperform gbtree on my setup
Stacking features
Knowledge distillation
OOF and confusion matrix analysis (false negatives and false positives): could not find any insight that I could be sure it led to better performance (I blame the anonymized features for that 😆)
Denoising autoencoder (not sure if I implemented it correctly)
TabNet
GRU
MLP (keras)
