The experience of this competition is extraordinary for me, due to the noise data of PB, I think I am really lucky to enter the gold medal zone, because most people's PB scores are very close. I really appreciate all the discussion topics and public notebooks, and I learn a lot from it. Thank you very much！Congratulations to all the people and teams who won the medals !
Solution

two schemes were selected to submit:

1. the first submission: no secondary processing for noise label

CV 0.90398 | LB 0.906 | PB 0.901

this scheme is the best CV in local. It uses a lot of augmentation, including randomcrop, H/V flip, a large number of RGB transform, cutout, grid distortion, etc.,

6modelx4TTA:

model	loss	size
efficientnet_b4_ns	bi-tempered	512
seresnext101	bi-tempered	512
seresnext101	focalcos	512
seresnext50	bi-tempered	512
VIT_base16	focalcos	384
VIT_base16	bi-tempered	384
the results show that the scores of all ensemble submitted PB without secondary processing for noise label were between 0.898 and 0.902.

there are two results of PB 0.902:

3model and 5xrandomTTA:
CV --- | LB 0.902 | PB 0.902

model	loss	size
efficientnet_b4_ns	bi-tempered	512
seresnext101	bi-tempered	512
VIT_base16	bi-tempered	384
randomTTA is the same as the augmentation method in training, randomly 5 times

5model and 5xTTA:
CV --- | LB 0.901 | PB 0.902

model	loss	size
efficientnet_b4_ns	bi-tempered	512
efficientnet_b4_ns	focalcos	384
seresnext101	bi-tempered	512
VIT_base16	focalcos	384
regnety120	focalcos	512
2. the second submission: based on the prediction results of the first scheme, knowledge distillation is carried out, and the student model results and the teacher model results are weighted by a ratio of 4:6

CV 0.9063 | LB 0.902 | PB 0.900

the augmentation and the model structure is unchanged

6 student model and 4xTTA
CV 0.9079 | LB 0.901 | PB 0.898

model	loss	size
efficientnet_b4_ns	CE	512
seresnext101	CE	512
VIT_base16	CE	384
resnext101	CE	512
resnest101	CE	512
I think the student model overfitting the training set, so I tried various weighting methods with the predicted probability of the first scheme. The range of pb is between 0.898 and 0.902

3. something else (all changes to labels or delete labels are only for the training set, not the label of the validation set, keep the TRUE label in validation set)

(as a comparison of the following, no processing has been applied to the noisy label:
efficientnet-b4 5fold 5tta: PB 0.894, the following attempts all use this benchmark)

images with prediction probability greater than 0.9 and incorrect predictions are deleted. PB 0.895
the labels of images with prediction probability greater than 0.9 and incorrect predictions are changed. PB 0.896
simply aug + snapmix, and gradually increase the probability of snapmix by epoch. PB 0.896
2019+2020 Dataset, since the 2019 data set contains multiple sizes, and any resize/crop form will affect the final CV, I finally did not use the 2019 data ( The data for 2019 was deleted in the verification set) PB 0.895
focalcos loss will increase CV, but some models will reduce the prediction probability of true label.
in my submit, when using random TTA, the score of PB and LB are close.
RegNet PB is higher than LB, but RegNet LB is too low, RegNet is not selected for submit.
I am very glad to get my first solo gold, and I really look forward to 1st solution
