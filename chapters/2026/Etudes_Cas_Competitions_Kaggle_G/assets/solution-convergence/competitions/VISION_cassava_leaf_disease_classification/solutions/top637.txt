Firstly, congratulation to all competitors!

This is my regret for large shake down.

I used 3 type CNN.

SEResNext50 32x_4d public : 0.898 -> private : 0.895
EfficientNetB4 public : 0.899 -> private : 0.890
ViT_base_384 public : 0.899 -> private : 0.890
In final, I weights each model with 1 : 1.2 : 1.2 for ensemble.

Public LB : 0.905
Private LB : 0.896
I regret to overfit to public LB…

I thought this competition is my first silver, but result is reflecting my current ability.

And, I think the cause of weak model is below

using cutmix
don't use tempered loss
fixed random seed for cv through all model
I doubt seed ensemble can help me a little, but the bird has flown :(

The ensemble SEResNeXt50_32x4d + SEResNet152d_320

Public LB : 0.900
Pirvate LB : 0.899
The ensemble 1SEResNext50 32x_4d + EfficientNetB4 + ViT_base_384 (public:0.895, private:0.891)

Public LB : 0.902
Pirvate LB : 0.899
These model can get medal zone private score, but I don't know why bad score ViT is essential for good score. This competition definiely needs for early stopping for not perfect fitting training data?

Please tell me how do you think cutmix , tempered loss, seed and so on and your preventing shake method.
